## 能够使用的等宽字体

- Consolas 

  Consolas has been the modern monospace font of choice in Windows since Windows Vista. Web browsers and the Command Prompt still defaults to the much older Courier New for legacy compatibility reasons. Consolas has been the default font in Visual Studio (VS) and VS Code for years already.

- Cascadia Code

  Cascadia Code is a monospace/fixed-width font where all the characters and punctuation mark has the same width. This is useful for tabulating data, source code, and terminals. Cascadia Code also features optional programming ligatures; a feature that combines character sequences common in programming into symbols. It’s the first font from Microsoft to feature programming ligatures. (Cascadia contains some common typographic ligatures, but that doesn’t count.)
